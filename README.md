### Access to Safe and Affordable Drinking Water
Project Overview
I undertook a mission to address the worldwide issue of ensuring access to safe and cost-effective drinking water. This extensive initiative sought to comprehend and revamp the data concerning the availability of drinking water.

### Part 1: Understanding Access to Water
In the first part of my project, I looked at the data closely to understand different aspects of water access. I found that the estimated global urban population in 2020 was about 1.70% different from what the dataset showed. This showed how important it is to have accurate data when we're trying to understand the size of the problem.

By using graphs and analyzing the data, I corrected some wrong ideas and learned new things about how people get water depending on their income and where they live. For example, I found that basic water services are more common in places with more people living in cities and higher incomes.

### Part 2: Transforming the Data and Analyzing Trends
In the next phase of the project, I honed in on the representation of years and the yearly rates of change. I examined the dataset's timeline and looked at how the yearly rates of change were distributed between rural and urban areas. Interestingly, I noticed that there were more countries experiencing higher rates of change in rural areas, suggesting a necessity for focused interventions in these regions.

Furthermore, when I delved into regional variations, I found that Sub-Saharan Africa exhibited the most significant enhancement in access to basic water services nationwide. This underscored the critical need to tackle regional inequalities and adopt long-lasting solutions.

Above is a visual representation of the project's findings, displayed in the dashboard format. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of access to safe and affordable drinking water, showcasing the insights gained from the data analysis.

### Conclusion
This project serves as a reminder that access to clean water is a fundamental human right. By understanding the challenges, analyzing trends, and implementing targeted interventions, we can work towards a sustainable future where everyone has access to safe and affordable drinking water.
